# MELD
MELD (MEC-based Edge Loss Discrimination) is a novel server-side loss discrimination mechanism that leverages recent advancements in Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) services to discriminate packet losses based on real-time RAN statistics. MELD is built on top of picoquic (https://github.com/private-octopus/picoquic), all the experiments have been performed on r2lab (https://r2lab.inria.fr). Find below the required steps in order to reproduce the results shown in the paper.

# Step 1 : Building OAI and FlexRAN infrastructure on r2lab
